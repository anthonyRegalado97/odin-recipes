      <h2 class="description-header">Description</h2>
      <p>
        Oven Baked Chicken Teriyaki is a flavorful and easy dish that combines
        tender, juicy chicken with a rich, savory-sweet teriyaki glaze. Baked to
        perfection, the chicken absorbs the deep umami flavors of soy sauce,
        ginger, garlic, and honey, creating a deliciously caramelized coating.
        This fuss-free recipe delivers the taste of classic teriyaki without the
        need for constant stovetop attention, making it perfect for a quick
        weeknight dinner. Serve it over rice or steamed vegetables for a
        wholesome and satisfying meal.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved;
          set aside. Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red
          pepper flakes together in a saucepan over medium heat until the
          mixture starts to simmer. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring to
          a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened,
          stirring often, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. Pour
          sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the
          center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read
          thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees
          F (75 degrees C).
