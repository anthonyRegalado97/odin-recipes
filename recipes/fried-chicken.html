        that delivers all the flavor and crunch of traditional fried chicken
        with less oil. Marinated in tangy buttermilk and coated in a seasoned
        flour mixture, each piece is air-fried to perfection, resulting in
        juicy, tender meat with a perfectly crispy crust. This easy and

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place chicken thighs in a shallow casserole dish. Pour buttermilk over
          chicken and refrigerate for 4 hours, or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Mix flour, seasoned salt, and pepper in a large gallon-sized
          resealable plastic bag. Dredge chicken thighs in seasoned flour. Dip
          back into buttermilk, then coat with panko bread crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spray the air fryer basket with nonstick cooking spray. Arrange 1/2 of
          the chicken thighs in the basket, making sure none are touching. Spray
          top of each chicken thigh with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Flip the thighs and
          spray tops of chicken again. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in
          the center and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An
          instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
          165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Repeat with remaining chicken.
